	The penguin is drawn using several functions named after each body part
(i.e. drawBody, drawHead etc.). These functions are all called from the drawAll
function, which takes care of all transformations keeping body parts in the 
correct position relative to each other. The drawing functions for specific body
parts are only responsible for specifying the points that make up that part.
No scales are used since it makes it easier to specify the relative positions
of the body parts. 
	The display callback handles setting the polygon mode (wireframe, solid,
or outlined) as well as the material property (matte/metallic). Outlined is
rendered almost the same as solid, except on a second pass we keep the colour
as black and redraw over the penguin.
	The light position is also handled in the display callback. It is 
defined to be on a circle parallel to the XY-plane.
	The animation is of the penguin walking and briefly looking around.
